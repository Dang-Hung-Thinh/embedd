```### This repository demonstrates:

* How to build a custom Linux kernel.

* How to use the kernel's Makefile system to compile .ko (Kernel Object) modules, load them onto an embedded computer (e.g., Raspberry Pi), and control peripherals directly from the kernel.

* How to use WiringPi to interact with peripherals from user space.

* How to integrate user space applications with kernel modules:
* The kernel module handles low-level control (e.g., turning an LED on/off), while the user space program automates behaviors such as LED blinking.```
